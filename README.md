## instructions

## development


````node js Version: 8.19.3````

````express Version: 4.18.2````

````body-parser Version: 1.20.1````

````cros version: 2.8.5````

````JS Version: ES2015/ES6.````


````JS Standard: ESlint.````



The project is divided into two sides, the server side and the client side.

### 1- the Server Side
- create var named ```projectData ``` for stor the data that user send in it.
- require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.
- configuring express to use body-parser and cros moudels.
- Initialize the main project folder and create get and post route ```/all```.
- setup lestin with feedback sohw message in the case server running sucsicfly;
### 2- the Client Side
- In the css file, I rearranged the elements to give them some aesthetic appearances.
- In the html file you have created the necessary elements to enter the necessary data as well as the elements to display the results.
- The majority of the work was done on app.js, there is a lot of things done there:


### global variables
the global variables well use in all the app
1. const variable ``apiKey`` my personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API.


2. const variable ``APIurl`` The main part of OpenWeatherMap API URL.

3. const variable ``server`` server url router ``all``.

4. const variable ``cityDataElement`` input elment city  data.

5. variable ``units``  For temperature units its ``"imperial"`` (Fahrenheit) by default ,the user can chaenge it to ``"metric"`` (celsius) or ``"standard"`` (kelvin).

6. variable ``cityby`` type of city data is zip by default user can chaenge it to city name or city id.

7. variables ``time`` , ``date`` stor time and date in string.


### Helper Functions
I used the Helper Functions into the main functions

1. ``citydata``,``openweathermapUrl`` 2 Helper arrow functions to build completed Url to API .

2. ``getDataFromoOpenWeatherMap`` helper arrow function using fetch, chain Promises  make a GET request to get data from api .

3. ``sendDataToServer`` helper async function using fetch (async , await) make a POST request to send data to server .
  
4. ``setingDataInProjectOpject`` arrow function with 1 pramter Api data and return oject  cotuin slictions data from Api data and user input.

5. ``viweError`` function to viwe error message in GUI.

6. ``viweData`` function to viwe weather data in GUI.

### main Functions 
the main functions well be used in the eventlisteners

1. ``generate`` callback  fuction with chain Promises to generate data , eventlistener  ``click`` Generate button.

2. ``generateByPosition`` callback  fuction with chain Promises to generate data using user postion (latitude And longitude) , eventlistener  ``click`` Generate by position button.

3. ``chaengModeCity`` by cett function the user can select ``cityBy`` name or city id and of cours city ZIP, eventlistener  ``change`` City Code.
 
4. ``chaengModeTemperture`` function to change temperature mode (f,C,K),   eventlistener  ``change`` City Code.

5. ``showTimeAndDate`` function to show time and date, set interval evrey 1 sacand.

##### note : I have added console messages at all stages of the application to facilitate the process of tracking errors and to understand the code better.
